# üöÄ End-to-End Workflow with PaddleOCR

## üéØ Objective

This directory provides a complete, hands-on guide to utilizing the **PaddleOCR** framework for building and training custom text detection and recognition models. The goal is to demonstrate a full, reproducible workflow, from data preparation and model configuration to training and inference, using practical Jupyter notebooks.

This serves as the central, practical application part of the larger repository, complementing the from-scratch implementations in `/Paper Implementation with Pytorch` and the alternative detection methods in `/Darknet and YOLO`.

## üìÇ Project Structure

-   **/data**: A placeholder directory where you should place your raw datasets (e.g., COCO-Text, ICDAR). The notebooks will process this data and create structured output.
-   **/notebooks**: Contains the step-by-step Jupyter notebooks that form the core of this guide.
    -   `1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`: Converts standard datasets into PP-OCR compatible formats for both detection and recognition.
    -   `2_Detection_Training.ipynb`: A complete workflow for training a text detection model (DBNet).
    -   `3_Recognition_Training.ipynb`: A complete workflow for training a text recognition model (CRNN/SVTR).
-   **/scripts**: (Optional) Can be used to store supplementary Python scripts, such as complex data conversion or evaluation logic.
-   **/trained_models**: (Optional) A suggested location to save your final trained model weights and logs.

##  workflow-steps Workflow & How to Use

Follow the notebooks in sequential order to complete the entire OCR training pipeline.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data üìù

-   **What to do:** Start with the `notebooks/1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`.
-   **Goal:** This notebook guides you through converting your labeled image dataset into the specific `.txt` formats required by PaddleOCR for both text detection (bounding polygons) and text recognition (cropped words and their transcriptions). It also handles the creation of training and validation splits.

### Step 2: Train a Text Detection Model üñºÔ∏è

-   **What to do:** Open and run `notebooks/2_Detection_Training.ipynb`.
-   **Goal:** Learn how to configure a model (like DBNet with a MobileNetV3 backbone), point it to your prepared dataset, and launch the training process using PaddleOCR's tools. After training, you will test the model by running inference on a sample image to visualize the detected text boundaries.

### Step 3: Train a Text Recognition Model üî°

-   **What to do:** Open and run `notebooks/3_Recognition_Training.ipynb`.
-   **Goal:** Use the cropped word images and labels from Step 1 to train a text recognition model (e.g., CRNN or SVTR). This notebook covers creating a character dictionary, configuring the model, and launching the training. Finally, you will test the trained model on a single word image to see its transcription accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies Used

-   **Framework**: **PaddleOCR** (v3.0+), a powerful and versatile open-source OCR toolkit.
-   **Text Detection**: Primarily utilizes **DBNet** (Differentiable Binarization), which excels at detecting text of various shapes and sizes in real-time.
-   **Text Recognition**: Employs **CRNN** (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) with CTC loss as a classic and effective baseline, with newer versions like **SVTR** (Scene Vision Transformer) available for higher accuracy.
